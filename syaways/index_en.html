				<p id="project_introduction-body">Syaways is an online booking trip platform targeting young european travelers. With a powerful new algorithm, Syaways can combine routes from different travel companies and come up with exclusive, customisable and cheap itineraries. Starting only from a client brief, my team and I lead a full UX process to eventually come up with a high-fidelity prototype of the Syaways website.</p>

					<h3 class="project_step-title">Defining</h3>
					<p class="project_step-content">After reviewing the client brief with them, our team recapped the technical constraints and plotted the differents steps we would need to conduct in our UX process. We built a 2-month retro-planning and used it to share the tasks between ourselves.</p>

					<h3 class="project_step-title">Discovering - user research</h3>

					<section class="project_substep">
						<h4 class="project_substep-title">Quantitative data — from secondary sources, i.e. other studies 📚</h4>
						<p class="project_substep-content">
							I gathered various studies covering topics relevant to our subject, such as millenial demographics, online booking, or traveling habits in Europe. To further ensure the <strong>reliability of the data</strong>, I only picked recent studies (mostly from the current or previous year) carried out by recognised source (e.g. Phocus Wright, Expedia, KPMG). I went through those 14 studies and synthesised the most relevant figures in order to get a broad impression of our marker and our users.</p>
						<p>This first quantitative data would <strong>help us narrow the rest of our user research</strong>, towards more qualitative data.</p>
					</section>


				<section class="subsection">
						<h4 class="project_substep-title">Qualitative data — from primary sources, i.e. the users themselves 🙇🙇‍♀️</h4>
						<p class="project_substep-content">
							So, I had the main characteristics of our users and our market. Now, in order to gather more relevant and qualitative data, I redacted <strong>an online survey</strong> with Google Form, more specific to the Syaways service. I reviewed this survey with the other team members, removing any bias or ambiguity to ensure the accuracy of the data I would gather.</p>

						<figure class="primarysearch_survey">
							<a class="image-popup" href="img/primarysearch_survey.jpg"><img src="img/primarysearch_survey.jpg"></a>
							<figcaption>The survey we sent to other 100 participants (you can check it out here, in French : <a href="http://www.goo.gl/hWAtMY" class="clickable-link">www.goo.gl/hWAtMY</a>)</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>After I got enough respondents, I <strong>analyzed the survey results</strong> with the software Tableau Public. <strong>Two user profiles emerged</strong> : that would the drafts of our upcoming personas.</p>


						<figure class="primarysearch_survey">
							<a class="image-popup" href="img/primarysearch_cells.jpg"><img src="img/primarysearch_cells.jpg"></a>
							<figcaption>From raw data in spreadsheets...</figcaption>

							<figcaption>... to precise data analysis (software used : Tableau Public)</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p class="project_substep-content">
							Then, my teammates <strong>interviewed</strong> users about their booking and traveling habits in order to gather <strong>direct insights</strong> and verbatims. Also we tested the users on concurrent websites  in order to see the dos and the don’ts of online booking websites (spoiler : everybody hates chatbots !).</p>
						<p>Finally, the other team members and I summarized our user research data into <strong>two personas : Anna and Carl</strong>. Theses personas would allow to empathize with the user during the upcoming conception phase. We also built an experience map for each persona, in order to spot where our product could improve their travel experience.
						</p>

						<figure class="project_step-artifact">
							<a class="image-popup" href="img/persona_anna.PNG"><img src="img/persona_anna.PNG"></a>
							<figcaption>Example of one of our personas, Anna. She is a young and adventurous student. As her experience map shows, she loves to get inspired and share her trip on the social media. However, as she is not a seasoned traveller, she gets anxious during the phases of purchasing and stopover.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							We quickly identified <strong>how stressful would be the buying process</strong>. One of the reason why is that, because of technical constraints, Syaways would not yet internalize the ticket-buying step in its platform — meaning users might have to go buy tickets onto separate airline websites. We knew we would have to work hard to make that step less stressful.
						</p>

						<p>
							With feedbacks from the client, I also wrote a <em>Job to be done</em>, which is a one sentence résumé of what the user wants to accomplish and in what context. It is a powerful tool when designing task-oriented interfaces such as Syaways’. Indeed, during the design phase,it will help us remember the different goals our product should meet : functional, social, and emotional.
							</br>The <em>Job to be done</em> for Syaways was : <strong><em>"I want to create the best journey offer for me in order to enjoy a succesful trip.</em></strong> Concise and efficient, right ?

				<section class="subsection">
					<h3 class="project_step-title">Ideation</h3>
					<p class="project_step-content">Having built our personas, experience maps and Job to be done, we were able to <strong>make people empathize</strong> with our users and their goals. From there, I leaded several ideation workshops called Crazy Eight, with the client team and potential users, to <strong>generate a maximum of ideas</strong> and to nurture our creativity.</p>

						<figcaption>Example of one sheet of Crazy Eight, with the ideas drawn by one of the participants and the green stickers representing a vote from another team member</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p class="project_step-content">We had lots of crazy ideas, now we needed to <strong>sort them out</strong>. So during a workshop with the client, we reviewed these ideas, and then I lead a Crzay Eight alternative workshop : this time, participants should come up with more realistic and applicable ideas in the light of our Job to be done, our personas and our experiences maps. This served as the preparation for our first prototypes.

				<section class="subsection">
					<h3 class="project_step-title">Design and user test iterations</h3>
					<p>I used our persona’s experience maps to write <strong>standard scenarios of a user booking a trip online</strong>. Containing context and detailed directives, this scenario can be used as a protocol for prototype testing. The protocol is clear and robust, so it can collect consistent and comparable data throughout all range of prototypes, from low to high fidelity. Also, even after the project is complete, other UX designers will be able to use this protocol to test further improvements in the future.</p>
					<p>After gathering the data from our co-conception workshops, I created <strong>low-fidelity paper wireframe</strong>, in order to <strong>quickly iterate with my team through website structure options and usability issues</strong>. Thanks to this step, we decided for a one-page structure with inner tabs and a very guided check-out process. That first fast iteration saved us a lot of time, as we quickly got rid of obvious issues that would have came up anyway when testing our later prototypes.
					</p>

					<figure class="project_step-artifact">
						<a class="image-popup" href="img/wireframes.jpg"><img src="img/wireframes.jpg"></a>

						<figcaption>Detail of one page of the wireframes : the "search and explore" page</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>Afterwards, I quickly built a <strong>low-fidelity prototype</strong> to begin rudimentary testing with real users, in particular regarding the overall web page structure.</p>

					<figure class="project_step-artifact">
						<a class="image-popup" href="img/lofi_prototype.PNG"><img src="img/lofi_prototype.PNG"></a>
						<figcaption>Low-fidelity prototype : the "search and explore" page (software used : Axure)</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>After the result of the first tests, we built a <strong>high-fidelity prototype</strong>. Indeed, it was important to test the visuals, as our interface depended a lot on it, in terms of graphics and cognitive psychology (see <a class="clickable-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping">Gestalt laws</a>). The testing on this prototype helped us improve the organisation of the filters and simplify the check-out pop-up. 
					</p>

						<a class="image-popup" href="img/highfi_prototype.png"><img src="img/highfi_prototype.png"></a>
						<figcaption>Dynamic high-fidelity prototype : the "search and explore" page(software used : Adobe XD</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>We eventually ended up with a <strong>second version of our high-fidelity prototype</strong> that could be tested under a certain number of scenarios (booking, changing minds, exploring the travel possibilities). This prototype, along with the results of the tests performed on it, was ultimately our final rendering to the client.</p> 
				</section>

			</section>




			<section class="main_section" id="project_conclusion">
				<h2 id="project_conclusion-title">Results and learnings</h2>



					<p><strong>The final user tests</strong> of the high-fidelity prototype turned out OK, with a great success rate and understanding of the specificity of Syaways’ new algorithm.</p>
					<p> Due to technical constraints, <strong>the check-out process</strong> was unfortunately still a big stressful bottleneck for users, despite all the efforts we put to make it the smoothest and most reassuring possible. Internalizing the check-out process was our number 1 recommendation for Syaways.</p>

					<p>As of October 2018, Syaways'website is live and running in its beta version.

					<h3>Some thoughts and key learnings</h3>
					<ul class="listwrapper">
						<li class="li-good_stuff"><p>Conducting <strong>co-conception workshops</strong> with creative people was real fun, especially when it comes to roleplaying and empathizing with our users, really coming to understand them, and finding the right ideas that they would appreciate</p></li>
						<li class="li-good_stuff"><p> Focusing on conducting <strong>a thorough and reliable user research</strong> was a great investiment of ressources, as it turned out to be really helpful for all the following steps of our design process.</p></li>
						<li class="li-challenge_stuff"><p><strong>The biggest challenge of this mission was time</strong> ; we had a 2-month deadline for a school-like project, meaning we still had full time jobs on the meantime ! Moreover, interactions with the users (interviews, surveys, tests) take an incompressible amount of time, and can not be rushed ; in order to have enough relevant data, planning is mandatory.</p></li>
						<li class="li-challenge_stuff"><p>The work with the team also had its obstacles, as we all had different working habits, regarding communications channels (Slack, Facebook, texts, Google Drive, OneDrive), writing and prototyping softwares (Axure, Adobe XD, Sketch), and even operating systems  ! Surely this added <strong>friction and redundancy</strong> in the process, as we did not take the time to learn other softwares just for this mission. It eventually turned out OK because we were aware of this issue and hence we carefully split the tasks.</p></li>
						<li class="li-interesting_stuff"><p> Our extensive user research taught us some interesting things about online booking user experience. In particular that, despite recent trends, <strong>travelers actually <em>hates</em> chatbots</strong> when it comes to booking a trip online — it seems opaque and doesn't give enough sensation of control to the user. It was also interesting to see how small is the mobile usage during a booking process (only 16%, source “Les chiffres clés 2017”, Fédération e-commerce et vente à distance, June 2017), and how stressful this process is for the user !</p></li>
						<li class="li-interesting_stuff"><p>Teamwork is crucial, everyone in the team had its specific strengths and it was essential to use them</p></li>
						<li class="li-love_stuff"><p>
						<strong>It was great having the opportunity to conduct a complete UX process, from the client brief to the high-fidelity prototype ready to be implemented. An overall very rewarding challenge !</strong></p></li>
